# Personal-Portfolio

This is the V2.0 of my personal portfolio that uses a react + tailwind approch as compared to V1.0 where html + css was used. 
My default website is still atlantis357.github.io. However, my new site, abrahamalkhatib.com, is slowly being upgraded and wil soon replace my current portfolio
